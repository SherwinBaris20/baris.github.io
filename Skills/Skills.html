	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have plenty of interests that I wanted to try but too scared to try<sup>1</sup>. Just like playing basketball<sup>2</sup>. Im too scared because everyone is way too tall and fast for me to keep up<sup>3</sup>. I always wonder what would it feel like me playing basketball shooting and dunking<sup>4</sup>. I put this interest in one of my to do list and goals that maybe someday I would put myself in position<sup>5</sup>. Watching basketball games makes me wants to be interest in this sports more but the only thing that stop me is Im not athletic enough<sup>6</sup>. Some of my personal interest sometimes revolve around Online Games<sup>7</sup>. Its like everytime I play and sit and enjoy it the time is so fast<sup>8</sup>. My interest in this Online Games and Basketball has been growing over the years into wanting to try playing basketball and joining an esport team<sup>9</sup>. Well I guess it would not be too late to try them and explore them even more<sup>10</sup>.
